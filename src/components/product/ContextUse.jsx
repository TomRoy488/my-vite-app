          Traditionally, Brihatri Avipattikara Churna is taken after meals to
          aid digestion. It is often incorporated during seasonal transitions,
          such as the onset of summer, to help maintain digestive balance.
          Following an Ayurvedic routine, it is recommended to consume it
          under the guidance of a qualified practitioner to align with your
          individual constitution.
