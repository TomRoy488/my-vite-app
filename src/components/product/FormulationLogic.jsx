            The formulation of Brihatri Avipattikara Churna is rooted in the
            principle of balancing Pitta and Kapha doá¹£as, using herbs that
            support digestive fire while cooling excess heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            This strategic blend is designed to work synergistically with the
            body's natural rhythms, promoting overall digestive harmony.
